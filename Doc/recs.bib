  abstract = {In this paper we analyze commodity programs in which the government
	attempts to support and stabilize price through open market purchases
	and sales. Specifically, we assess the effects of such programs on
	the U.S. soybean market using a rational expectations model that
	allows for private storage, expected price-responsive production,
	and arbitrary support and release prices. Stochastic simulations
	of the model demonstrate that price stabilization programs can reduce
	long-run market price and destabilize producer revenue.},
