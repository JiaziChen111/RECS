  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the theory of saving when consumers are
	not permitted to borrow, and with the ability of such a theory to
	account for some of the stylized facts of saving behavior. When consumers
	are relatively impatient, and when labor income is independently
	and identically distributed over time, assets act like a buffer stock,
	protecting consumption against bad draws of income. The precautionary
	demand for saving interacts with the borrowing constraints to provide
	a motive for holding assets. If the income process is positively
	autocorrelated, but stationary, assets are still used to buffer consumption,
	but do so less effectively and at a greater cost in terms of foregone
	consumption. In the limit, when labor income is a random walk, it
	is optimal for impatient liquidity constrained consumers simply to
	consume their incomes. As a consequence, a liquidity constrained
	representative agent cannot generate aggregate U.S. saving behavior
	if that agent receives aggregate labor income. Either there is no
	saving, when income is a random walk, or saving is contracyclical
	over the business cycle, when income changes are positively autocorrelated.
	However, in reality, microeconomic income processes do not resemble
	their average, and it is possible to construct a model of microeconomic
	saving under liquidity constraints which, at the aggregate level,
	reproduces many of the stylized facts in the actual data. While it
	is clear that many households are not liquidity constrained, and
	do not behave as described here, the models presented in the paper
	seem to account for important aspects of reality that are not explained
	by traditional life-cycle models.},

	attempts to support and stabilize price through open market purchases
	and sales. Specifically, we assess the effects of such programs on
	the U.S. soybean market using a rational expectations model that
	allows for private storage, expected price-responsive production,
	and arbitrary support and release prices. Stochastic simulations
	of the model demonstrate that price stabilization programs can reduce
	long-run market price and destabilize producer revenue.},
