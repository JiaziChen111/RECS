  states: [A]

  controls: [S, P]

  expectations: [EP]

  shocks: [e]

  parameters: [k, delta, r, elastD]


equations:

  arbitrage:

    - A-(EP*(1-delta)/(1+r)-k)^elastD  |            0 <= S <= inf
    - EP*(1-delta)/(1+r)-k             | A^(1/elastD) <= P <= inf

  transition:

    - A = (1-delta)*S(-1)+e

  expectation:

    - EP  = P(1)
